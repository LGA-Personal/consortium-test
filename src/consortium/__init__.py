Consortium: Heterogeneous Distributed Inference with Fuzzy Verification

A proof-of-concept distributed inference system demonstrating:
- Pipeline-parallel inference across heterogeneous hardware (CUDA + Metal)
- Fuzzy verification using canonical-grid commitments
- Optimistic audits with random sampling
- Fault tolerance with automatic failover
